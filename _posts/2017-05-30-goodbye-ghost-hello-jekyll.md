description: I'm moving my blog off Ghost and onto Jekyll. Oh, also an easier domain!
---

Hello, üåç! 

I've decided to move my content and all my future writing under my personal domain and start using a new (old) blogging engine.

For a while now, I've been using Ghost Pro to run my site, geniously titled [Space Cowboy Rocket Company (dot com)](https://www.spacecowboyrocketcompany.com). It's worked nicely and well, without any issues, I really liked the managed aspect of it that required me to fiddle with zero servers. But I've been thinking of moving away from it for a while now, as there's absolutely nothing Ghost can offer me than other platforms can't.

Furthermore, Firebase have released a new version of their static site hosting product - and this time this also supports [Google Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/functions)! Meaning, I could trigger some limited serverside javascriptery from my statically generated sites. Pretty dang cool if you ask me.

So here I am, back to square one, back using Jekyll to generate my stuff. I've also decided to change to a different domain, namely one that's a lot simpler to remember - [www.markan.me](https://www.markan.me).
The old domain will still work and point to Ghost as I transfer all the content over to the new one and then work as a redirect. (Of course I will sit on the domain name unti I've actually started my rocket company)

So that's that.

Zan out.
